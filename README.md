This code is written in C and emulates a File System. The program supports directories and 
"regular" files, allows a user to navigate the file system (change between directories), 
and allows the user to modify the file system (e.g., add/move directories and files).

The code was entirely authored by myself, Joseph Hammana for a Systems Programming class at Cal Poly SLO.
